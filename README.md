![Mortar](/Development/Art/Banner.png)

Mortar allows you to create Auto Layout constraints using concise, simple code statements.

```swift
addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(
    item:        view1,
    attribute:  .Right,
    relatedBy:  .Equal,
    toItem:      view2,
    attribute:  .Left,
    multiplier:  1.0,
    constant:   -12.0
))
```

Turns into:

```swift
view1.m_right |=| view2.m_left - 12.0
```

# Usage

Mortar does not require closures of any kind.  The Mortar operators (```|=|```, ```|>|``` and ```|<|```) instantiate and return constraints that are activated by default.  

Mortar will set ```translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints``` to ```false``` for every view declared on the left side of an operator.


### Equal, Less or Greater?

There are three mortar operators:

```swift
view1.m_width |=| 40                // Equal
view1.m_width |>| view2.m_width     // Greater than or equal
view1.m_size  |<| (100, 100)        // Less than or equal
```

### Attributes

Mortar supports all of the standard layout attributes:

* ```m_left```                   
* ```m_right```                  
* ```m_top```                    
* ```m_bottom```                 
* ```m_leading```                
* ```m_trailing```               
* ```m_width```                  
* ```m_height```             
* ```m_centerX```            
* ```m_centerY```            
* ```m_baseline```           

And iOS/tvOS spceific attributes:

* ```m_firstBaseline```     
* ```m_leftMargin```         
* ```m_rightMargin```        
* ```m_topMargin```          
* ```m_bottomMargin```       
* ```m_leadingMargin```      
* ```m_trailingMargin```     
* ```m_centerXWithinMargin```
* ```m_centerYWithinMargin``` 

It also supports composite attributes:

* ```m_sides -- (left, right)```
* ```m_caps -- (top, bottom)```
* ```m_size -- (width, height)```
* ```m_center -- (centerX, centerY)```
* ```m_cornerTL -- (top, left)```
* ```m_cornerTR -- (top, right)```
* ```m_cornerBL -- (bottom, left)```
* ```m_cornerBR -- (bottom, right)```
* ```m_edges -- (top, left, bottom, right)```
* ```m_frame -- (top, left, width, height)```

### Implicit Attributes

_Mortar will do its best to infer implicit attributes!_

The ```m_edges``` attribute is implied when no attributes are declared on either side: 

```swift
view1.m_edges |=| view2.m_edges     // These two lines
view1         |=| view2             // are equivalent.
```

If an attribute is declared on one side, it is implied on the other:

```swift
view1.m_top   |>| view2             // These two lines
view1         |>| view2.m_top       // are equivalent.
```

You are required to put attributes on both sides if they are not the same:

```swift
view1.m_top   |<| view2.m_bottom
```

### Multipliers and Constants

Auto Layout constraints can have multipliers and constants applied to them.  This is done with normal arithmetic operators.  Attributes must be explicitly declared on the _right_ side When arthmetic operators are used.

```swift
view1.m_size  |=| view2.m_size  * 2         // Multiplier   
view1.m_left  |>| view2.m_right + 20        // Constant
view1         |<| view2.m_top   * 1.4 + 20  // Both -- m_top is implied on the left
```

You can also set attributes directly to constants:

```swift
view1.m_width |=| 100                // Single-dimension constants
view1.m_size  |=| 150.0              // Set multiple dimensions to the same constant
view1.m_size  |>| (200, 50)          // Set multiple dimensions to a tuple value
view1.m_frame |<| (0, 0, 50, 100)    // Four-dimension tuples supported
```

Arithmetic can be done using tuples for multi-dimension attributes:

```swift
view1.m_size  |=| view2.m_size + (50, 30)
view1.m_size  |>| view2.m_size * (2, 3) + (10, 10)
```

The special inset operator ```~``` operates on multi-dimension attributes:

```swift
view1         |=| view2.m_edges ~ (20, 20, 20, 20)  // view1 is inset by 20 points on each side
```

### Multiple Simultaneous Constraints

Multiple constraints can be created using arrays:

```swift
view1 |=| [view2.m_top, view3.m_bottom, view4.m_size]

/* Is equivalent to: */
view1 |=| view2.m_top
view1 |=| view3.m_bottom
view1 |=| view4.m_size
```

```swift
[view1, view2, view3].m_size |=| (100, 200)

/* Is equivalent to: */
[view1.m_size, view2.m_size, view3.m_size] |=| (100, 200)

/* Is equivalent to: */
view1.m_size |=| (100, 200)
view2.m_size |=| (100, 200)
view3.m_size |=| (100, 200)
```

This might be a convenient way to align an array of views, for example:

```swift
[view1, view2, view3].m_centerY |=| otherView
[view1, view2, view3].m_height  |=| otherView
```



# Keeping Constraint References

The basic building block is the ```MortarConstraint```, which wraps several ```NSLayoutConstraint``` instances that are relevant to multi-affinity attributes like ```m_frame``` (4) or ```m_size``` (2).

You can capture a ```MortarConstraint``` for later reference:

```swift
let constraint = view1.m_top |=| view2.m_bottom
```

The raw ```NSLayoutConstraint``` elements can be accessed through the ```layoutConstraints``` accessor:

```swift
let mortarConstraint = view1.m_top |=| view2.m_bottom
for rawLayoutConstraint in mortarConstraint.layoutConstraints {
    ...
}
```

You can create an entire group of constraints:

```swift
let group = [
    view1.m_origin |=| view2,
    view1.m_size   |=| (100, 100)
]
```

Mortar includes a convenient typealias to refer to arrays of ```MortarConstraint``` objects:

```swift
public typealias MortarGroup = [MortarConstraint]
```
